/**
 *
 * Challenge: Use `CyclicBarrier` to simulate a simple race with 3 runners
 *
 * Scenario:
 * You have 3 runner threads. Each runner prepares (sleeps for a random short
 * time to simulate preparation),
 * then waits at the starting line. Once all runners are ready, they start
 * running together (print a "started running" message) and then finish.
 *
 * Your tasks:
 * 1. Create 3 threads representing runners.
 * 2. Each runner should:
 *
 * * Sleep randomly between 1-3 seconds to simulate preparation.
 * * Wait at the starting line using `CyclicBarrier`.
 * * After all runners reach the barrier, print a message saying the race has
 * started.
 * * Then print a message that the runner has finished.
 *
 * 3. Use the barrierâ€™s **barrier action** feature to print `"All runners are
 * ready. Race started!"` exactly once when all runners arrive.
 *
 * ### Key learning goals:
 *
 * * Understand how threads wait on the barrier.
 * * Use the barrier action to trigger a task after all threads arrive.
 * * See how threads resume after the barrier is passed.
 *
