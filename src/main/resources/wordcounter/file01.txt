The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange.
A gentle breeze rustled through the leaves of the old oak tree.
Childrenâ€™s laughter echoed from the distant playground.
A solitary bird perched on the fence, surveying the scene.
Nightfall promised a canopy of stars over the quiet town.
